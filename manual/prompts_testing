/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-01 It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-02 Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-03 It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-04 But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-05 Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-06 After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-07 Had it struck squarely it would have killed him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-08 The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-09 Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-10 And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-11 It was steel, a fisher trap
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-12 OW, a wild dog, he growled
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-13 He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-14 That is the strange part of it
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-15 His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-16 For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-17 In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-18 She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-19 His teeth shut with a last click
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-20 It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-21 In a flash he was on his feet, facing him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-22 He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-23 The moon had already begun its westward decline
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-24 They laughed like two happy children
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-25 He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-26 Fast, but endure
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-27 A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-28 The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-29 He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-30 Then he shouted, Shut up
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-31 He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-32 On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-33 To these he gave castor oil
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-34 Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-35 Sheldon glanced at the thermometer
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-36 I'll see to poor Hughie
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-37 Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-38 Also, I want information
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-39 Let them go out and eat with my boys
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf19-40 I, I beg pardon, he drawled
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-01 Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-02 Now it was missing from the wall
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-03 He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-04 I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-05 Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-06 If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-07 Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-08 Only the chance sound had led him to observe them
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-09 Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-10 There was no chance to fire without hitting him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-11 There was no answer from the other side
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-12 Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-13 With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-14 Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-15 In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-16 Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-17 It is the nearest refuge
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-18 There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-19 The truth of it set Jeanne quivering
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-20 Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-21 You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-22 He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-23 In it there was something that was almost tragedy
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-24 Your face is red with blood
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-25 Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-26 He can care for himself
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-27 They will search for us between their camp and Churchill
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-28 Until I die, he exclaimed
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-29 Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-30 The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-31 For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-32 I want to die in it
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-33 Darkness hid him from Jeanne
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-34 And yet if she came he had no words to say
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-35 He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-36 Within himself he called it no longer his own
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-37 Besides, that noise makes me deaf
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-38 Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-39 Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf17-40 There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-01 Philip dropped back into his chair 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-02 If I was out of the game it would be easily made 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-03 MacDougall, my engineer, believes it 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-04 It is growing, every day, every hour 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-05 Now, you understand 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-06 You have associated with some of these men 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-07 And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-08 Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-09 All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-10 Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-11 Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-12 He caught himself with a jerk 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-13 How does your wager look now 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-14 He confessed that the sketch had startled him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-15 After all, the picture was only a resemblance 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-16 He wondered, too, where Roscoe was 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-17 Philip knew that she was not an Indian 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-18 In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-19 Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-20 The thought set his blood tingling
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-21 But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-22 Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-23 It won't be for sale
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-24 For a few moments he ate in silence
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-25 Philip did not pursue the subject
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-26 Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-27 Suppose you saw me at work through the window
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-28 He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-29 There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-30 All this day Gregson remained in the cabin
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-31 The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-32 The flush was gone from her face
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-33 That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-34 He understood the meaning of the look
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-35 She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-36 I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-37 They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-38 We must achieve our own salvation
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-39 In moments of mental energy Philip was restless
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf16-40 He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-01 Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-02 What the flaming
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-03 Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-04 Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-05 With them were Indians, also three other men
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-06 Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-07 Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-08 He was just bursting with joy, joy over what
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-09 At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-10 Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-11 He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-12 I never saw anything like her in my life
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-13 There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-14 Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-15 There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-16 And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-17 Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-18 But we'll just postpone this
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-19 There was the Emma Louisa
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-20 This is my fifth voyage
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-21 Gad, do I remember it
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-22 You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-23 I can see that knife now
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-24 When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-25 His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-26 He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-27 Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-28 Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-29 I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-30 He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-31 His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-32 Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-33 Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-34 Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-35 They robbed me a few years later
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-36 He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-37 Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-38 I was completely lost in my work
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-39 His slim hands gripped the edges of the table
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf15-40 He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-01 Without them he could not run his empire 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-02 For such countries nothing remained but reorganization 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-03 They could not continue their method of producing surpluses 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-04 At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-05 The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-06 Nowhere did the raw earth appear 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-07 The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-08 Men who endure it, call it living death 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-09 As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-10 Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-11 In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-12 May drought destroy your crops 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-13 Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-14 But Johannes could, and did 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-15 A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-16 He would destroy all things that are fixed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-17 He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-18 What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-19 I should like to engage just for one whole life in that 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-20 Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-21 The Warden with a quart of champagne 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-22 Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-23 I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-24 He may anticipate the day of his death 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-25 The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-26 I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-27 Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-28 Also, churches and preachers I had never known 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-29 Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-30 This also became part of the daily schedule 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-31 All an appearance can know is mirage 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-32 Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-33 I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-34 Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-35 Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-36 Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-37 The last refugee had passed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-38 And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-39 Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf14-40 His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-01 Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-02 You live on an income which your father earned
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-03 He was worth nothing to the world
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-04 Then you don't believe in altruism
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-05 The creative joy, I murmured
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-06 He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-07 Ah, it is growing dark and darker
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-08 I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-09 A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-10 No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-11 I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-12 Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-13 Eighteen hundred, he calculated
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-14 The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-15 I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-16 But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-17 What I saw I could not at first believe
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-18 The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-19 There's too much of the schoolboy in me
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-20 I had forgotten their existence
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-21 Ah, we were very close together in that moment
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-22 But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-23 They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-24 Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-25 He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-26 Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-27 And so early in the voyage, too
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-28 In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-29 The eastern heavens were equally spectacular
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-30 He spat it out like so much venom
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-31 I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-32 He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-33 The night was calm and snowy
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-34 I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-35 His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-36 At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-37 Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-38 Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-39 I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf12-40 Tom Spink has a harpoon  
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-01 The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-02 Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-03 His newborn cunning gave him poise and control 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-04 Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-05 It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-06 And that was the last of Francois and Perrault 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-07 Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-08 The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-09 He could feel a new stir in the land 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-10 So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-11 It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-12 There is another virtue in these bulkheads 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-13 But I am at the end of my resources 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-14 Now our figuring was all right 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-15 It lasted as a deterrent for two days 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-16 The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-17 It is also an insidious, deceitful sun 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-18 The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-19 The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-20 When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-21 By golly, the boy wins 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-22 Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-23 McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-24 Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-25 Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-26 They do not know the length of time of incubation 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-27 Enters now the psychology of the situation 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-28 It was not exactly a deportation 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-29 Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-30 Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-31 Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-32 The boy at the wheel lost his head 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-33 To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-34 A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-35 What do you mean by this outrageous conduct 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-36 But Martin smiled a superior smile 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-37 By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-38 At sea, Monday, March sixteen, Nineteen oh Eight 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-39 At sea, Wednesday, March Eighteen, Nineteen oh Eight 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf11-40 Yes, sir, I corrected
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-01 The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-02 This is a common experience with all of us 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-03 He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-04 It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-05 Whiz-zip-bang Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-06 Cherokee identified himself with his instinct 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-07 They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-08 The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-09 Ah, indeed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-10 Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-11 Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-12 Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-13 This is no place for you 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-14 He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-15 Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-16 So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-17 Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-18 The fighting had now become intermittent 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-19 They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-20 It was like the beating of hoofs
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-21 Why, doggone you all, shake again 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-22 Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-23 You mean for this State, General, Alberta 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-24 He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-25 She was trying to pass the apron string around him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-26 Get down and dig in 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-27 They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-28 They only lifted seven hundred and fifty 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-29 It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-30 Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-31 It was more like sugar 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-32 I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-33 Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-34 Fresh meat they failed to obtain 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-35 A burst of laughter was his reward 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-36 You don't catch me at any such foolishness 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-37 A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-38 They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-39 Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf9-40 But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion  
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-01 I think it's much nicer to quarrel 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-02 I saw it when she rolled 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-03 I only read the quotations 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-04 He was the soul of devotion to his employers 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-05 Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-06 You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-07 They ought to pass here some time today 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-08 I had been sad too long already 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-09 All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-10 He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-11 I may manage to freight a cargo back as well 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-12 O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-13 He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-14 Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-15 You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-16 See the length of the body and that elongated neck 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-17 They are coming ashore, whoever they are 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-18 Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-19 Think of investing in such an adventure 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-20 Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-21 I have been doubly baptized 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-22 They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-23 Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-24 And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-25 The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-26 They handled two men already, both grub-thieves 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-27 Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-28 Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-29 That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-30 And after the bath a shave would not be bad 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-31 Now please give a plain statement of what occurred 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-32 You can take a vacation on pay 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-33 They are big trees and require plenty of room 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-34 And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-35 There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-36 Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-37 McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-38 It would give me nervous prostration 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-39 She said with chattering teeth 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf7-40 I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes  
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-01 He cried, and swung the club wildly 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-02 She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-03 They were following the shore of a lake 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-04 The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-05 From now on we're pals 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-06 He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-07 How much was it 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-08 Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-09 It was not a large lake, and almost round 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-10 Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-11 It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-12 Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-13 Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-14 Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-15 They die out of spite 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-16 The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-17 Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-18 The ringing of the big bell aroused him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-19 At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-20 A dead man is of no use on a plantation
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-21 I don't know why you're here at all 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-22 What part of the United States is your home 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-23 My, I'm almost homesick for it already 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-24 She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-25 I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-26 That came before my A B C's 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-27 It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-28 But it contributed to the smash 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-29 The last one I knew was an overseer 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-30 Do you know any good land around here 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-31 The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-32 I cannot follow you, she said 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-33 I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-34 Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-35 His voice was passionately rebellious 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-36 Don't you see I hate you 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-37 So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-38 It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-39 He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf6-40 Wash your hands of me
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-01 Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-02 That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-03 Philip made no effort to follow 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-04 He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-05 They are to attack your camp tomorrow night 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-06 Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-07 I was near the cabin, and saw you 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-08 Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-09 Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-10 There was none of the joy of meeting in his face 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-11 And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-12 Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-13 The date was nearly eighteen years old 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-14 They were the presage of storm 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-15 Down there the earth was already swelling with life 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-16 For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-17 She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-18 Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-19 Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-20 If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-21 So cheer up, and give us your paw 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-22 This time he did not yap for mercy 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-23 And the air was growing chilly 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-24 Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-25 The questions may have come vaguely in his mind 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-26 Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-27 Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-28 Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-29 The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-30 Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-31 For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-32 He did not rush in 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-33 It was edged with ice 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-34 He drank of the water cautiously 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-35 But a strange thing happened 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-36 He began to follow the footprints of the dog 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-37 Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-38 Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-39 Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf5-40 He leapt again, and the club caught him once more  
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-01 They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-02 Two years ago I gave up civilization for this 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-03 She had died from cold and starvation 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-04 It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-05 He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-06 Each day she became a more vital part of him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-07 It was a temptation, but he resisted it 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-08 This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-09 Her face was against his breast 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-10 She was his now, forever 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-11 Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-12 A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-13 Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-14 He obeyed the pressure of her hand 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-15 I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-16 About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-17 Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-18 In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-19 He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-20 Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-21 It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-22 Such things had occurred before, he told Philip 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-23 Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-24 But there was something even more startling than this resemblance 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-25 I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-26 Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-27 A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-28 Now these things had been struck dead within him 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-29 For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-30 Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-31 And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-32 Philip thrust himself against it and entered 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-33 MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-34 He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-35 Won't you draw up, gentlemen 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-36 A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-37 He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-38 Does that look good 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-39 They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf04-40 You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-01 Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-02 Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-03 For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-04 Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-05 Will we ever forget it 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-06 God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-07 And you always want to see it in the superlative degree 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-08 Gad, your letter came just in time 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-09 He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-10 I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-11 If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-12 Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-13 He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-14 Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-15 It's the aurora borealis 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-16 There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-17 From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-18 There was a change now 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-19 I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-20 Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-21 It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-22 Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-23 A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-24 It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-25 I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-26 It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-27 To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-28 Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-29 Their forces were already moving into the north country 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-30 I had faith in them 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-31 They were three hundred yards apart 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-32 Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-33 He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-34 Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-35 He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-36 She turned in at the hotel 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-37 I was the only one who remained sitting 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-38 We'll have to watch our chances 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-39 The ship should be in within a week or ten days 
/Volumes/1/E6998_testing/vf1-40 I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here
